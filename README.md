# Dividendspro Ledger v1.1

**Cryptographically Auditable Deterministic Infrastructure for Trading Signals.**

This repository hosts the `dividendspro-ledger`, a public, tamper-evident log of trading signals generated by the DividendsPro engine.

## Core Features

-   **Deterministic Signal Feed**: Hourly signals generated from on-chain data.
-   **Tamper-Evident Ledger**: Every entry is cryptographically linked (SHA-256 hash chain) to the previous entry.
-   **Cryptographic Authenticity**: Every entry is digitally signed using Ed25519.
-   **Automated Validation**: Daily statistical reports generated by GitHub Actions.
-   **Zero-Cost Infrastructure**: Runs entirely on GitHub Actions and GitHub Pages/Repo.

## Ledger Structure

The ledger is stored in `ledger/signals/` as JSONL files.

**Entry Format:**
```json
{
  "asset": "So11111111111111111111111111111111111111112",
  "score": 74.21,
  "state": "BREAKOUT_CONFIRMED",
  "ruleset_version": "1.1.0",
  "timestamp_utc": "2026-02-17T05:00:00Z",
  "previous_hash": "a1b2c3d4...",
  "entry_hash": "e5f6g7h8...",
  "signature": "base64_signature..."
}
```

## Verification

You can independently audit the ledger using the provided tools.

### 1. Verify Digital Signatures
Ensure that a specific entry was signed by the official Dividendspro key.

```bash
python ledger/verification/verify_signature.py --public-key <PUBKEY> --entry '{"asset":...}'
```

### 2. Verify Hash Chain
Ensure that the entire history is intact and unmodified.

```bash
python ledger/verification/verify_chain.py --public-key <PUBKEY>
```

## Validation Reports

Automated 30-day performance reports are generated daily in `ledger/validation/reports/`.
These reports include:
-   Signal survival rates (>70% Mcap retention).
-   False Positive/Negative rates.
-   Statistical separation tests (Kruskal-Wallis).
